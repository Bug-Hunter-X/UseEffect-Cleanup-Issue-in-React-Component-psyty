This repository demonstrates a common React error related to improper cleanup in useEffect hooks. The `bug.js` file showcases a component that adds a window resize event listener without correctly removing it when the component unmounts, potentially leading to memory leaks.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code with proper cleanup.  This is a critical issue, particularly in components that handle frequent events or large amounts of data.
